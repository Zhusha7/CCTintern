# F1 Season Points Calculator

Hello! This is my submission for the internship application.

## What It Does

This simple calculator lets quickly add up season points from Formula 1 races:

-   Enter where a driver placed in each of the 5 races
-   The calculator adds up the points based on F1's scoring system
-   First place gets 25 points, second gets 18, and so on down to 10th place (1 point)
-   If a driver finishes outside the top 10, they get zero points

## Tech Used

Almost nothing:

-   HTML5
